# 1. Preprocessing

SIP supports the preprocessing of raw data to extract enhanced images and features as input to the classification algorithms. Parameters are illustrated using landsat8 as an example.  

```
landsat8_params:
    landsat8_zip_dir: /home/l44xu/SIP2/data/landsat8_raw_zip
    raw_landsat8_format: tar.gz
    to_unzip: False
    multilook_num: 1
    low_percentage_to_remove: 0.02
    high_percentage_to_remove: 0.02
    output_raw_img_dir: /home/l44xu/SIP/data/landsat8_preprocessed_imgs/
```

**1.1 Unzip the raw data.** If ***to_unzip*** is True, the raw data files with extension ***raw_landsat8_format*** in folder ***landsat8_zip_dir*** will be extracted into separate folders. 

**1.2 Multilooking to reduce size.** To reduce image size, a image patch of size ***multilook_num*** by ***multilook_num*** will be averaged into a single pixel in the preprocessed images. 

**1.3 Remove extrame pixels.** To increase image contrast for better visualization, low intensity pixels of percentage ***low_percentage_to_remove*** will be set to the value 0, and high intensity pixels of percentage ***high_percentage_to_remove*** will be set to the value 255. After this, the dynamic range of image will be extended. 

**1.4 Save preprocessed images.** The preprocessed images will be saved into folder ***output_raw_img_dir***.
 
# 2. Preparing data 

SIP automatically prepares data for classification. No manual operatoins are needed. 

```
raw_data_params:
    raw_img_dir: /home/l44xu/SIP/data/landsat8_preprocessed_imgs
    raw_img_type: tiff
    raw_id_str_range: #from 'start' to 'end' in the name of the raw image are the string that differenciate different scenes
        start: 10
        end: 34
    raw_band_names: # each raw scene contrain the following bands, each of which is a seperate image in 'raw_img_type' format
        - B2
        - B3
        - B4
```

**2.1 Define the folder of your images** In ***raw_img_dir***, you have multiple scenes, each scene may have multiple bands/channels covering the same location/target. All bands/channels have the format of ***raw_img_type***.

**2.2 How does SIP discriminate different scenes.** To tell SIP about this, you need to make sure that the file name of different scenes within range ***raw_id_str_range*** are different. For example, if ***start*** is 1 and ***end*** is 8, then 20200101_B2.tiff and 20200505_B3.tiff are two different scenes. But, 20200101_B2.tiff and 20200101_B3.tiff are of the same scene. 

**2.3 How does SIP know which bands/channels you want to use.** To tell SIP about this, you need to specify ***raw_band_names*** with different ID names, and make sure your images contain these ID names. In the above code, for each scene, three images whose file name contrain respectively ***B2***, ***B3***, and ***B4*** will be used. 
   

# 3. Copy the prepared data to different folders

SIP copies data to separate folders for different stages, i.e., ***train***, ***validation***, ***test*** and ***prediction*** stages. 

* **train** folders contain ***data***, ***mask*** and ***result*** for training the classifier.

* **val** folders contain ***data***, ***mask*** and ***result*** for validating the classifier during training or model selection. 

* **test** folders contain ***data***, ***mask*** and ***result*** for testing the accuracies of the classifiers. 

* **prediction** folders contain ***data***, ***mask*** and ***result*** for predicting new images once the model is finalized. ***prediction*** images do not have ground truth masks, but ***test*** images must have ground truth masks to estimate accuracies. 

For each stage, i.e., train, validation, test and prediction, there are ***data***, ***mask*** and ***save*** folders. 

* **data** folders contain prepared bands/channels for each scene. The file format of each scene is defined by ***image_type***. Each scene has a file in the data folder. 

* **mask** folders contain ground truth mask files. The file format is defined in ***mask_type***. Now SIP only supports the ***png*** format.

* **save** folders contain all results generated by SIP classifiers.
